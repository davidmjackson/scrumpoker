# Scrum Poker Session Log

## 2026-05-08 - Development Kickoff

Branch: `feature/scrum-poker-baseline`

Starting state:
- Repository path: `/var/www/scrumpoker`
- Source branch before kickoff: `master`
- Latest baseline commit: `f4a0091 Reduce scanner noise in frontend comments`
- Working tree at kickoff: untracked `docs/` directory containing `docs/scrum-poker-handover.md`
- Server status: no `node server.js` process was running

Last verified baseline from the handover:
- Live root page returned `200 OK`
- Live WebSocket opened and returned a `yourId` message
- `node --check server.js` passed
- `node --check public/js/app.js` passed
- `npm test` failed because no test script exists
- `npm audit --omit=dev` reported 4 production dependency vulnerabilities

Recommended next steps:
- Commit the handover and session log on a feature branch.
- Add focused baseline coverage for current WebSocket behavior.
- Add a `/health` endpoint.
- Review dependency audit findings and remove unused dependencies where practical.
- Use the Retrospective design and structure patterns for later UI and architecture work.

Work completed:
- Created and committed kickoff docs in `b68973f Add Scrum Poker kickoff docs`.
- Added `SCRUM_POKER_KEYS_FILE` so tests and future deployments can point at an explicit keys file without exposing local secrets.
- Added `/health`, returning status, uptime, and active room count.
- Added `npm test` using Node's built-in test runner.
- Added WebSocket baseline tests for health, login, facilitator/voter/observer behavior, voting, reveal, reset, role restrictions, and invalid access keys.
- Removed unused `animejs` and ran `npm audit fix`, updating vulnerable production transitive dependencies.

Verification:
- `node --check server.js`
- `node --check public/js/app.js`
- `node --check tests/ws-operations.test.js`

- Keep reset behavior and vote state unchanged.

Work completed:

- Make the reset face-down phase visibly start as soon as the facilitator clicks `Reset Votes`.
- Keep the two-phase sequence: right-to-left face-down, then left-to-right face-up.
- Preserve behavior for other connected users.

Work completed:
- Added a local reset animation guard so the facilitator starts the face-down phase before the reset WebSocket message is sent.
- Delayed sending `resetVotes` until the local face-down phase completes.
- Kept non-clicking clients on the state-update-driven face-down animation path.

  - Renamed old `origin` remote to `bitbucket`.
  - Added `origin` as `git@github.com:davidmjackson/scrumpoker.git`.
  - Fetched and switched production to `origin/main` at `b1f167b Add admin activity log`.
- Installed production dependencies with `npm ci --omit=dev`.
- Updated `scrumpoker.service` to set:
  - `NODE_ENV=production`
  - `PORT=3000`
  - `SCRUM_POKER_ADMIN_KEY`
  - `SCRUM_POKER_KEYS_FILE=/var/www/scrumpoker/keys.json`
  - `SCRUM_POKER_ACTIVITY_FILE=/var/www/scrumpoker/admin-activity.jsonl`
- Restarted `scrumpoker.service`.
- Removed a stale extra `node server.js` process so only the systemd-managed Node process remained.
- Added Apache vhost config for `sprintpoker.uk` and `www.sprintpoker.uk`.
- Used Certbot to issue and deploy the `sprintpoker.uk` and `www.sprintpoker.uk` certificate.
- Confirmed Certbot added HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects.
- Removed the old local shell alias/banner setup from the IONOS user's `.bashrc`.
- Removed old untracked `/var/www/scrumpoker/README.txt` from production.

Verification:
- `curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:3000/health`
- `curl -fsS -H 'Host: sprintpoker.uk' http://127.0.0.1/health`
- `curl -fsSI http://sprintpoker.uk/`
- `curl -fsS https://sprintpoker.uk/health`
- `curl -fsS https://sprintpoker.uk/admin | grep -E 'Team access|Recent activity|Team keys'`
- `curl -fsS https://sprintpoker.uk/ | grep -E 'Scrum Poker|Sprint|access-key-input|voting-deck' | head`
- Node WebSocket smoke test against `wss://sprintpoker.uk/ws`
- `systemctl is-active scrumpoker.service apache2`

Result:
- `https://sprintpoker.uk` is live.
- `http://sprintpoker.uk` redirects to HTTPS.
- `https://sprintpoker.uk/health` returned healthy with `rooms: 0`.
- `/admin` serves the new admin UI with team keys and recent activity.
- `wss://sprintpoker.uk/ws` opened successfully.
- `scrumpoker.service` and `apache2` were active.
- Production checkout reported `## main...origin/main`.

Notes:
- The production admin key was set in the systemd service during deployment. Treat it as a secret and rotate it if it has been shared beyond the deployment session.
- The old alias banner may continue to show in already-open shells because `.bashrc` was loaded before cleanup. It should be gone in new SSH sessions.

- Leave server-side round history behavior in place for compatibility, but remove browser rendering and copy controls.

Work completed:
- Removed the Revealed rounds / History section from the Poker Room.
- Removed individual and copy-all history browser code.
- Removed history-specific CSS.
- Kept Vote Results and Grouped Results behavior unchanged.
- Bumped the app script query to `js/app.js?v=11`.

Work completed:
- Renamed the facilitator-only `Start Next Item` button to `Next Round`.
- Updated server-side facilitator/reveal prerequisite messages to say `next round`.
- Bumped the app script query to `js/app.js?v=12`.

- Production had been verified at commit `a1359697ccb0` with `/health` ok and `js/app.js?v=12`.

Decision:

- Keep the active-room workflow lightweight: vote, reveal, review grouped results, then move to the next round.

Work completed:
- Removed `currentItem`, `roundHistory`, round-history snapshots, and current-item helpers from room state.
- Removed the `setRoundItem` WebSocket handler and its server switch case.
- Renamed the current client/server next-round action path to `startNextRound`.
- Renamed the DOM control id to `start-next-round-button`.
